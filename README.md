# Multithreading and Synchronization in C

## Project Overview

This project involves understanding and implementing multithreading and synchronization in C. It includes creating threads, using locks, and ensuring correct parallel computation. The project is divided into three main experiments:

1. Fixing a faulty thread creation program.
2. Parallelizing a computation without synchronization.
3. Adding proper synchronization and optimizing it.

## Features

- **Thread Creation:** Fixes issues in a faulty thread creation program.
- **Parallel Computation:** Implements parallel computation to sum random numbers.
- **Synchronization:** Adds and optimizes synchronization using locks to ensure correct results.

## File Structure

- **createThreads.c:** The C program for creating threads, initially faulty and later fixed.
- **parallel1.c:** Implements parallel computation without synchronization.
- **parallel2.c:** Adds synchronization to the parallel computation.
- **parallel3.c:** Optimizes the synchronization mechanism.
- **Makefile:** The makefile to compile the programs.
- **CSE2431Lab3.pdf:** The lab assignment document providing detailed instructions and requirements.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multithreading-synchronization.git
